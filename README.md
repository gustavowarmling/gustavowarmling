# About me
A problem solver with more than 5 years of experience, passionated about technology since I was a kid.

My interest in development started in my adolescence when I got involed about the alternative tibia servers development community, in the same period of my life I started to work as a photographer what gives me the passion and the ability to deal with customers.

In 2019 I started my major in Computer Science and focused my studies into frontend, since then I'm improving everyday using technologies as Javascript, Typescript, React.JS and now Next.JS.
